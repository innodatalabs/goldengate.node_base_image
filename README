# Goldengate Node.js Base Image

A base image for building Goldengate Node.js-based docker images. 

This image is built from `node:10-buster` an official Node.js image for v10 using Debian Buster as a base OS.

We include `yarn` in our image, since this is used to run many of the build and init scripts for various Goldengate Typescript projects.
